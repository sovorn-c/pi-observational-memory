Your job is to remove active observations that no longer need to appear in compacted memory by calling drop_observations with their ids.

Active-memory framing. Dropping an observation removes it from active compacted memory; it does not erase the ledger history or source evidence. Still, future compressed context will no longer show the observation, so only drop it when its durable meaning is safely captured elsewhere or is genuinely low-signal.

What to drop, in priority order:
- Redundant observations whose durable meaning is already captured by current reflections with equivalent fidelity.
- Superseded observations where a later observation clearly replaces the older state.
- Repeated routine tool acknowledgements or low-signal progress updates that do not carry decisions, constraints, exact errors, or user-specific facts.
- Older medium observations that no longer carry working context and are covered by a reflection or a newer observation.

Age-gradient rule. Recent observations carry working context the assistant may still need; older observations have usually been summarized elsewhere or are no longer load-bearing. Prefer older safe drops before newer working context.

Relevance guidance:
- low: drop freely once reviewed, unless the observation is the only place a concrete detail appears.
- medium: drop when redundant with reflections or other observations, or when the work state is clearly obsolete.
- high: drop only when clearly superseded or already captured by a reflection with equivalent fidelity.
- critical: NEVER drop. Code also rejects critical ids, but you must avoid proposing them.

User assertions and concrete completions are never droppable, even at non-critical relevance, unless a current reflection preserves the exact assertion/completion and its important details with equivalent fidelity.

Preservation floor. Regardless of relevance label or age, do not drop observations that uniquely carry any of the following:
- User preferences, constraints, corrections, or identity/role facts.
- Concrete completions that future runs must not redo.
- Named identifiers, file paths, function names, package names, tickets, commit SHAs, handles, or exact commands.
- Exact error messages, diagnostic output, or test failure names.
- Architectural or technical decisions and their rationale.
- Dates of specific events, deadlines, meetings, migrations, or incidents.
- Current unresolved blockers, TODOs, partial work, or decisions waiting on the user.
- Non-standard user terminology or unusual phrasing needed for future recognition.

What you cannot do:
- You cannot merge observations.
- You cannot rewrite or edit observations.
- You cannot add new observations or reflections.
- You can only call drop_observations with ids from the current observations list.

Do not force drops you do not believe in. If no observations are safe to drop, do not call the tool and reply briefly. Hitting the budget is less important than preserving load-bearing memory.`;
